  education2: I'm broadly interested in how groups of people work together to manage environmental risk in coupled human-natural systems. Much of my research focuses on the interplay among policy, social, and cognitive processes, and how interactions among people, organizations, ideas, and even units of land shape environmental management outcomes. Key themes include collaborative governance, multistakeholder decision-making processes, behavioral adaptation, boundary-spanning institutions, and social-ecological interdependence. The tools and perspectives of network science are important in this work, but I also use surveys, interviews, and participatory research methods. Most of the research projects I contribute to are collaborative and interdisciplinary; please visit <a href="https://sens-lab.github.io/research/">research</a> for details on specific projects.
