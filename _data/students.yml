  education2: Harrison is a PhD student in Environmental Social Sciences. His research focuses on how people work together to solve complex environmental problems. Specifically, he adopts a social-ecological network approach to understand climate change adaptation governance, which is an issue that is complex both socially and ecologically. His existing research is informed by several theories of environmental governance, including institutional (or social-ecological) fitness and the Ecology of Games Theory. In his free time, Harrison enjoys to spend time with his friends and family, attend Ohio State football games, and explore Columbus.
